# TF2 Community Links for Steam
A user script that adds various links to TF2 competitive leagues and TF2/Steam community sites to a Steam Community Profile page for quick and easy access.
* User script only functions on steam profile pages
* Removes padding from below user status and badges for a more compact viewing experience with added links.
   * Note: does not remove padding from below profile links, groups, and friends for better user visibility.
* Ability to disable specific site links by clicking on your respective script manager icon and then clicking on `TF2CLS Options`.
   * By default all sites are enabled.
   * Saving options will automatically refresh the page to display newly selected options.
